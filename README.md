An interactive collection of Pokémon using the Poke API located at pokeapi.co that contains 700+ searchable Pokémon.  When clicked, your character, Ash, will shout "I Choose You!" while a Pokéball rolls down from the top of the screen, then opens, and then an animated sprite of the selected Pokémon appears, along with his official stats!
